# Cases-pubg — PUBG Cases Trading Community (2017)

A responsive, cross-browser front-end layout for a PUBG community website where users could exchange cases/skins through the service. I implemented the responsive UI for several pages based on the client’s design and deliverables. The layouts are static (no backend); interactive areas are designed and ready for integration.

## 🚀 What I Built
- **Responsive, cross-browser layout** (mobile/desktop) with consistent typography and spacing.
- **Navigation & header** with Steam login entry point (visual/UI only).
- **Cases catalog**: card grid with pricing and “open case” CTAs.
- **Stats blocks** showcasing opened cases, trades, users online, etc. (UI).
- **Promo code flow (UI)** for entering/activating codes.
- **Trades/Exchange page (UI)** prepared for inventory and swap interactions.
- **Case opening pages (UI)** featuring dedicated layouts for the “open” flow.
- **Leaderboard (Top)** and **FAQ** pages for community and support.
- **User profile** layouts prepared for inventory/history modules.

> **Scope:** front-end only (HTML/CSS/JS). Backend integrations (Steam auth, trading bots, payments) were out of scope.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript**
- Layout built with modern, semantic markup and adaptive styling
- Lightweight custom JS for interactive UI states (no server code)
